# 📊 parameswari-hub/WorkBooks-Repo: My Data Bootcamp Projects

This repository serves as a portfolio showcasing my hands-on experience and skills gained during a comprehensive data bootcamp. It covers the **end-to-end analytics lifecycle**, from data preparation to interactive reporting and cloud storage.

---

## 🚀 Overview
I learned to clean and prepare data in **Excel** and **Python** , write efficient **SQL** queries to retrieve and aggregate information from relational databases , and design interactive dashboards with **Power BI** and **Tableau**. I also worked with **Azure** cloud services to understand how to store and serve data for scalable analysis and reporting.

My practical work includes:
* Building pivot-driven dashboards and Excel reports.
* Automating data transforms with pandas in Python.
* Combining and summarizing data with `JOIN` and `GROUP BY` in SQL.
* Creating interactive, filterable dashboards for storytelling with Power BI and Tableau.
