My bootcamp projects

Introduction
I recently completed a comprehensive data bootcamp where I gained hands-on experience across the end-to-end analytics lifecycle. I learned to clean and prepare data in Excel and Python, write efficient SQL queries to retrieve and aggregate information from relational databases, and design interactive dashboards with Power BI and Tableau so stakeholders can explore key metrics. I also worked with Azure cloud services to understand how to store and serve data for scalable analysis and reporting.
My practical work includes building pivot-driven dashboards and Excel reports, automating data transforms with pandas, combining and summarizing data with joins and GROUP BY in SQL, and creating interactive, filterable dashboards for storytelling with Power BI and Tableau. I focus on clarity, reproducibility, and making data useful for decision-making.

<h2 style="font-size:1.45em">🟦 Week 1 — Excel</h2>
![Excel badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-Excel-1E90FF)

### Summary
- Core topics: Excel formulas (SUM, AVERAGE, IF), data cleaning (text-to-columns, remove duplicates), conditional formatting, pivot tables, and basic charts (bar, line, pie).
- Typical exercises: cleaning a small dataset, building pivot summaries, using lookup functions to combine data, and creating a simple dashboard.
- Key takeaways: how to prepare and summarize tabular data quickly, create repeatable reports with pivot tables, and use visualizations to highlight insights.

<h2 style="font-size:1.45em">🟪 Week 3 — SQL</h2>
![SQL badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-SQL-6A5ACD)

### Summary
- Core topics: SELECT, WHERE, JOIN (INNER/LEFT/RIGHT), GROUP BY, HAVING, ORDER BY, aggregate functions (COUNT, SUM, AVG), and subqueries.
- Typical exercises: writing queries to filter and aggregate data, joining multiple tables to create combined reports, and using GROUP BY to produce summary metrics.
- Key takeaways: ability to translate business questions into SQL queries and retrieve accurate, aggregated results from relational databases.

<h2 style="font-size:1.45em">🟨 Week 4 — Azure</h2>
![Azure badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-Azure-0080FF)

### Summary
- Core topics: cloud fundamentals relevant to data work — storage options (Blob, Data Lake), compute options (VMs, App Services), and managed data services (Azure SQL, Synapse). Intro to deploying data pipelines and storing datasets in the cloud.
- Typical exercises: outlining where to host datasets, connecting BI tools / scripts to Azure hosted data, and understanding basic security/auth (service principals, keys).
- Key takeaways: how cloud services fit into a data workflow and where to store/process data for scalable analytics.

<h2 style="font-size:1.45em">🐍 Week 5 — Python</h2>
![Python badge](https://img.shields.io/badge/Topic-Python-3776AB)

### Summary
- Core topics: Python for data analysis — pandas (DataFrame operations, grouping, merging), data cleaning, basic plotting (matplotlib/seaborn), writing reusable functions and scripts.
- Typical exercises: loading CSV/Excel, cleaning and transforming data with pandas, exploratory analysis and plotting, and saving cleaned outputs for BI tools.
- Key takeaways: automate repetitive data tasks, manipulate and analyze datasets programmatically, and prepare analysis-ready data for reporting.
